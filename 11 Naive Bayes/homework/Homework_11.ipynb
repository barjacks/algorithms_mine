      "                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\n",
      "This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I\n",
      "have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\n",
      "should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\n",
      "would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\n",
      "relevant books are listed in a companion article.\n",
      "To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\n",
      "as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\n",
      "questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\n",
      "up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\n",
      "frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n",
      "Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\n",
      "posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\n",
      "questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\n",
      "who proselytize on alt.atheism.\n",
      "So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\n",
      "Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\n",
      "being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\n",
      "may not.\n",
      "\"What is atheism?\"\n",
      "Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\n",
      "Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\n",
      "often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\n",
      "atheism\".\n",
      "It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\n",
      "atheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\n",
      "atheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\n",
      "fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n",
      "Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\n",
      "atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\n",
      "flat-out denials.\n",
      "\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n",
      "Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\n",
      "it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\n",
      "believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\n",
      "not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n",
      "\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n",
      "The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\n",
      "Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\n",
      "disclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\n",
      "must be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n",
      "Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\n",
      "sure whether God exists.\n",
      "Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\n",
      "you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\n",
      "that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\n",
      "use agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\n",
      "referring to \"strong atheism\".\n",
      "Beware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\n",
      "is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\n",
      "sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\n",
      "the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\n",
      "about the universe.\n",
      "\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n",
      "There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\n",
      "particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n",
      "Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\n",
      "is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\n",
      "such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\n",
      "see no evidence that God exists.\n",
      "\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n",
      "There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\n",
      "quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\n",
      "all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\n",
      "obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\n",
      "well-defined is a matter for debate.\n",
      "However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\n",
      "impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\n",
